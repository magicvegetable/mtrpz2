From https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Yuji_Itadori:

[1mYuji[0m is a fair [47m[30mperson[0m who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he [3mviews[0m as people with their own [100mwills,[0m despite [1mhow deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends "the value of life," and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort.[0m

[100mHe is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train with Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei and his mother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as when Yaga questioned why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite na√Øve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, but is shown to be a quick **learner**, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly.

Although usually composed, good-natured and friendly, Yuji can be angered quickly in the face of pure malice after witnessing firsthand the cruelty that curses were capable of, particularly Mahito's inhuman exploitation of Junpei. Yuji felt so profoundly disgusted that he felt a genuine desire to kill for the first time in his life and has a very intense yet focused hatred towards the cursed spirit.
[0m

One of Yuji's [3mdefining traits is his willingness to[0m sacrifice himself for others, triggered by his grandfather's last words to him to die surrounded by others. When he and Megumi were under the threat of being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed [47m[30mSukuna's finger[0m to exorcise the curse and save them despite having met Megumi for the first time on that day.
